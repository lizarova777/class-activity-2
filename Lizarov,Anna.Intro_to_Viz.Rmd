#Input
```{r}
D1 <- read.csv("School_Demographics_and_Accountability_Snapshot_2006-2012.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

D2 <- subset(D1, schoolyear == 20112012)
```

#Histograms
```{r}
#hist()

hist(D2$frl_percent, breaks = 100)

hist(D2$frl_percent, breaks = c(0,10,20,80,100))

hist(D2$frl_percent, breaks = 100, ylim = c(0,30))
```

#Plots
```{r}
plot(D2$ell_num, D2$ctt_num)

plot(D2$ell_num ~ D2$ctt_num)

#Barplot
x <- c(1,3,2,7,6,4,4)
y <- c(2,4,2,3,2,4,3)

table1 <- table(x,y)

barplot(table1)

#Lineplot
D3 <- aggregate(D1, by = list(D1$schoolyear), FUN = mean)

plot(D3$schoolyear, D3$total_enrollment, type = "l", lty = "dashed")

#Boxplot
D5 <- subset(D1, DBN == "31R075")
D5 <- droplevels(D5)
boxplot(D5$total_enrollment ~ D5$Name)

pairs(D4)
```
# Exercise

1. Create a simulated data set containing 100 students, each with a score from 1-100 representing performance in an educational game. The scores should tend to cluster around 75. Also, each student should be given a classification that reflects one of four interest groups: sport, music, nature, literature.
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(123)
ID <- seq(1,100,1)
studentscore <- round(pmax(1, pmin(100, rnorm(n=100, mean=75, sd=10)))) #pmin and pmax is like floor and ceiling to have scores between 1 and 100, bounds it.
interest <- c("sport", "music", "nature", "literature")
Interest <- sample(interest,100,replace=TRUE)
(DF  <- data.frame(ID,studentscore, Interest)) 
```


2. Using base R commands, draw a histogram of the scores. Change the breaks in your histogram until you think they best represent your data.
```{r}
scores <- DF$studentscore
hist(scores, breaks=5, xlab= "Students' Scores", ylab="Frequency", main = "Histogram of Students' Scores")
```

3. Create a new variable that groups the scores according to the breaks in your histogram.

```{r}
lettergrades <- ifelse(scores >= 90, "A", ifelse(scores >= 80, "B", ifelse(scores >= 70, "C",ifelse(scores >= 60, "D", "F"))))   #nested ifelse statements
(DF2 <- cbind(DF, lettergrades))

```
```{r}
#or
lettergrades2 = cut(DF$studentscore, breaks=5, labels = LETTERS[1:5])
(DF4 <- cbind(DF,lettergrades2))
```


4. Now using the colorbrewer package (RColorBrewer; http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) design a pallette and assign it to the groups in your data on the histogram.

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)
colors <- c("#fde0dd", "#a6bddb", "#31a354", "#f03b20", "#8856a7")
hist(scores, breaks=5, col=colors, xlab= "Students' Scores", ylab="Frequency", main = "Histogram of Students' Scores")
```


5. Create a boxplot that visualizes the scores for each interest group and color each interest group a different color.
```{r}
boxplot(scores~DF2$Interest, col=colors, main = "Distribution of Students' Scores Grouped by Interests")
```


6. Now simulate a new variable that describes the number of logins that students made to the educational game. They should vary from 1-25.

```{r}
(logins <- sample(1:25, 100, replace=TRUE, prob=NULL))
(DF3 <- cbind(DF2, logins))
```

7. Plot the relationships between logins and scores. Give the plot a title and color the dots according to interest group.
```{r}
plot(DF3$logins, DF3$studentscore, xlab= "Logins", ylab="Scores", main="Relationship Between Logins and Scores", col=DF3$Interest, pch=19)

```


8. R contains several inbuilt data sets, one of these in called AirPassengers. Plot a line graph of the the airline passengers over time using this data set.
```{r}
(AP <- AirPassengers)
plot(AP, xlab= "Year", ylab="Passengers", type="o", pch =20) # Time-series Plot
#or
plot.ts(AP, xlab= "Year", ylab="Passengers")
#or
plot(AP)
```


9. Using another inbuilt data set, Iris, plot the relationships between all of the variables in the data set. Which of these relationships is it appropriate to run a correlation on? 
```{r}
(IR <- iris)
plot(IR)
#between Petal.Length and Petal.Width and between Sepal.Length and Petal.Length
```
