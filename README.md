# Introduction to Visualization.

## Project Objective:

The purpose of this project is to visualize the relationships between variables and simulate data using a dataset containing a hundred students. Some of the simulated data includes students' scores on an educational game, number of logins that students made to the educational game, and their interests.Also, a new variable was created, "lettergrade", where scores measured in percentage were grouped into letter grades. 

## Visualizations:
  
![boxplot](https://github.com/lizarova777/class-activity-2/blob/master/Boxplot.png)

The boxplot indicates that there is greater variability in scores for students that are interested in sports. Otherwise, the distribution of students' scores does not depend on the interests.  

![scatterplot](https://github.com/lizarova777/class-activity-2/blob/master/Scatterplot.png)

The scatterplot indicates that there is no relationship between the number of logins that students made to the educational game and their scores.
